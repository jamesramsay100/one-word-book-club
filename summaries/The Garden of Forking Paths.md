## Long summary
The History of the World War, by Liddell Hart, is a book that is not to be missed. It is a book that is not to be missed.  I'm a fucking genius.  I'm a coward.                                                                   I'm a big fan of the book, but this is a pretty good summary of the story.                                                                   A Chinese writer is pursued by a man who wants to kill him. He writes a book and a labyrinth to confuse his pursuer. The book is a mess, but the labyrinth is a masterpiece.    Time is a riddle.   I killed Stephen Albert.

## Short summary
I'm a fucking genius.
