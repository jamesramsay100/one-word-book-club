# Pierre Menard

## Title
Pierre Menard

## Long summary
Menard wrote a book about writing a book about Don Quixote, but the book about Don Quixote is better than the book about writing a book about Don Quixote.  																																																															  Menard's "real" work is a translation of the Quixote.  I'm going to write the Quixote.   I wrote a book that is the same as the Quixote, but not.  the Quixote is an impossible book to write, and Pierre Menard's attempt to write it is the most subtle Quixote ever written.  Menard is a genius, and the book is a masterpiece.  I'm not sure if I'm just being dense or if there's something I'm missing here, but I'm having a hard time understanding what this is about. I've read it multiple times and I still don't get it.

## Short summary
I don't get it.
