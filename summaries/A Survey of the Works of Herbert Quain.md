A Survey of the Works of Herbert Quain

## Long summary
the guy was a genius.   I'm a big fan of Quain's work, but I'm not sure if I'm a big fan of this book. I'm giving it a 3.5/5, but I'm not sure if I'm being generous or not.  The book is composed of nine stories, each of which is composed of three chapters. The first chapter is common to all nine stories. The second chapter of each story is a "possible" story that happened before the first chapter. The third chapter of each story is a "possible" story that happened before the  250 second  act  is                                                            Quain's work is an influence on Borges, and Borges' work is an influence on Quain.
