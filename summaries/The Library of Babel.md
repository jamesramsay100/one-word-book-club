# The Library of Babel

## Title
The Library of Babel

## Long summary
The Library is infinite, and the hexagon is the center of the universe.    The Library is a library, and all books are books.  I'm not sure what the "Vindications" are, but I'm pretty sure they're not the Vindications.  I think the Library is huge, and it's not worth it to destroy books.   I'm not sure if I should call this book a book or a pamphlet.
